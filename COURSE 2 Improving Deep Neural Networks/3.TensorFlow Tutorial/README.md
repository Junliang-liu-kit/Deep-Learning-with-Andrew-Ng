## TensorFlow Tutorial
Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PaddlePaddle, Torch, Caffe, Keras, and many others can speed up your machine learning development significantlyï¼Œeven sometimes also perform optimizations that speed up your code. All of these frameworks also have a lot of documentation, which we should feel free to read. In this assignment, we will learn to do the following in TensorFlow:<br>

* Initialize variables
* Start session
* Train algorithms
* Implement a Neural Network
