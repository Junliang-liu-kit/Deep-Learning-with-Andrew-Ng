## Optimization Methods
learn some more advanced optimization methods that can speed up learning and perhaps even get to a better final value for the cost function. Having a good optimization algorithm can be the difference between waiting days vs. just a few hours to get a good result.include:<br>

* Mini-batch
* Momentum alogrithm
* Adam alogrithm
